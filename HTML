    <h1>Hi Bebe!</h1>
    <p> Happy Birthday! today is the day to celebrate your extraordinary existence.
In the journey of life, I am grateful to have you by my side.
<br><br>
Between seas, galaxies, and moons, I was lucky I stepped on the same land, I dreamed under 
the same stars as you.
<br><br>
We've traversed oceans of memories, ventured through galaxies of experience, and basked 
beneath the beuty of moons together. I feel incredibly fortunate to share unforgettable
advetures with you.
<br><br>
Every step we take together is a part of the journey that shapes our unique story. Your 
smile illuminates each day, adding warmth to the surroundings.
<br><br>
May this year be a chapter filled with happiness, success, and love. Thank you for being a 
part of my life's story. Happy birthday, and may each of your days be filled with 
extraordinary joy and achievements!ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‚</p>
